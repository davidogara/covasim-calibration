# Utility functions for Figure 1 from Kerr et. al 2021

See the original repository here: https://github.com/amath-idm/controlling-covid19-ttq/tree/main/fig1_calibration

This repository contains a slimmed down version of the repository from Kerr et. al 2021 to facilitate running covasim simulations.

Please also see the notebook that preprocesses the original `fig1a.sims` to a csv file and performs some data analysis (used in `hetGPy-calibration/analysis`)
